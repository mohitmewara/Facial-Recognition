# Facial-Recognition
The purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate the performance of Principal Component Analysis and the K-means algorithms as they apply to the problems of biometric(facial) recognition and soft biometric (gender) classification.

There are three data set files for this project ProbeSet.rar, GallerySet.rar, and Gender.txt.
ProbeSet.rar contains facial images collected from 100 individuals (two images per person). 
Gallery-Set.rar contains 100 images collected from the same individuals (one image per person). 
Gender.txt contains information on the gender of each of the individuals in the data set.

The implemented algorithm is executed over the sample dataset and the results along with other findings are included in Report-FacialRecognition.pdf
